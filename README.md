## Projects

### Facial Keipoint Detection

[P1_Facial_Keypoints](https://github.com/vnegreanu/UCCV/tree/master/01_Facial_Keypoints)

#### Description

Use image processing techniques and Convolutional Neural Networks to detect keypoints on faces images
such as eyes, nose, mouth, teeth and chin.

### Image Captioning

[P2_Image_Captioning](https://github.com/vnegreanu/UCCV/tree/master/01_Facial_Keypoints)

#### Description

Combine an CNN encoder with a RNN decoder with LSTM units that produces a caption for each inpute image.

### Landmark detection and Tracking (SLAM)

[P3_SLAM](https://github.com/vnegreanu/UCCV/tree/master/03_SLAM)

#### Description

Implement SLAM algorithm (Simulaneous Localization and Mapping) for a possible robot movement in 2D.
